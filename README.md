#Hacker School Github Visualzation

I wanted to know what other [Hacker Schoolers](http://hackerschool.com) were working on, what their experience was pre- and post-hacker school and also what languages they were using. I created the Hacker School Project Visualization to answer these questions. To make it simple for everyone to download, test and fork, all the code is client-side. After requesting a lot of information from github, everything is cached in sessionStorage so browsing is very fast. [D3](http://d3js.org) was used for the visualization.

## Example

This is live at [http://hs.bn.ee](http://hs.bn.ee) - however the code is all client-side so you can just download and view it yourself.
